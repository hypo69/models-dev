### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Ensure Bot is Running
Make sure your bot is running. You should see a message in your console indicating the bot is logged in.

```plaintext
Logged in as YourBotName#1234
```

#### Step 2: Invite the Bot to Your Server
Ensure the bot is invited to your server with the necessary permissions to read messages and send messages.

#### Step 3: Prepare Your Training Data
You can train the model using text data or files containing the training data.

1. **Training with Text Data**:
   Prepare a string of text data that you want to use for training.

2. **Training with a File**:
   Prepare a file containing the training data. Ensure the file is accessible on your local machine.

#### Step 4: Use the Training Command

**Method 1: Using Text Data Directly**
1. In a Discord channel where the bot has access, type the following command:
   ```plaintext
   !train "Your training data here" positive=True
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !train "Sample training data" positive=True
   ```

**Method 2: Uploading a File**
1. Attach the file containing the training data in a message.
2. In the same message, type the following command and send:
   ```plaintext
   !train positive=True
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !train positive=True
   ```

The bot will save the file and start training the model with the provided data.

#### Step 5: Monitor Training
After you send the training command, the bot should respond with a message indicating the status of the training job:

```plaintext
Model training started. Job ID: <job_id>
```

#### Step 6: Verify Training Status
You can add additional commands to your bot to check the status of the training job if needed. This would typically involve querying the model object for job status.

#### Step 7: Testing the Model
Once the model is trained, you can test it with the test command.

1. Prepare a JSON string of test data.
2. In a Discord channel where the bot has access, type the following command:
   ```plaintext
   !test {"test_key": "test_value"}
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !test {"input": "Test input data"}
   ```

The bot will respond with the model's predictions.

#### Step 8: Using Additional Commands
Your bot also supports other commands such as archiving files and selecting datasets. Use these commands similarly to manage your data and model.

**Archiving Files**:
```plaintext
!archive <directory_path>
```
Example:
```plaintext
!archive /path/to/directory
```

**Selecting Dataset**:
```plaintext
!select_dataset <path_to_dir_positive> positive=True
```
Example:
```plaintext
!select_dataset /path/to/positive_data positive=True
```

### Summary
1. **Start Bot**: Ensure your bot is running.
2. **Invite Bot**: Make sure the bot is in your Discord server.
3. **Prepare Data**: Have your training data ready as text or in a file.
4. **Train Model**: Use the `!train` command with either text data or file attachment.
5. **Monitor Training**: Look for the bot's response about the training job status.
6. **Test Model**: Use the `!test` command with test data to verify model performance.
7. **Manage Data**: Use `!archive` and `!select_dataset` commands as needed.

To interact with your trained model through the bot, you need to add a command that allows users to ask questions and receive answers. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Guide to Adding a Q&A Command



1. **Start the Bot**: Make sure your bot is running.

2. **Ask a Question**:
   In a Discord channel where the bot has access, type the following command:

```plaintext
!ask What is the capital of France?
```

3. **Receive the Response**:
   The bot should respond with the model's answer:

```plaintext
Model response: The capital of France is Paris.
```

### Summary

1. **Add `ask` Command**:
   - Update your bot script to include the `ask` command.
   - Implement the `ask` method in your `Model` class to query the model and return a response.

2. **Run the Bot**:
   - Start your bot to make it available in your Discord server.

3. **Ask Questions**:
   - Use the `!ask` command to interact with the trained model and get answers.

By following these steps, you'll be able to ask questions to your trained model through your Discord bot and receive answers.
